# React + Vite

1. Display a Task Table using an editable table library such as Tabulator.js or similar.
2. Allow users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks dynamically.
3. Integrate dummy data using the provided placeholder API.

1. ADD Taskâž•
In this, we use React + vite with tailwind, Shadcn Ui to create this and tailwind also helps to make it responsive

2. Notifications
We used the state hook and made a form to put new tasks in the fields. After creating a new task, we used Reat-Toastifiy to show the notifications, which helped us find the task that was created.
