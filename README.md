# React + Vite

1. Display a Task Table using an editable table library such as Tabulator.js or similar.
2. Allow users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks dynamically.
3. Integrate dummy data using the provided placeholder API.


. Editable Task Table
- Use Tabulator.js to display a table with the following columns:
   - Task ID
   - Title
   - Description
   - Status: Dropdown with options 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Done.'
- Allow inline editing for the Title, Description, and Status fields.
- Implement a button to delete a task from the table.


In this, we use React + vite with tailwind, Shadcn Ui to create this and tailwind also helps to make it responsive
